# Garantido - An Introduction

This project aims to host a number of other projects that will be using the
Rust programming language.

Right now, I'm in the process of learning Rust and will place some projects on
here as I go.

I think that Rust can help a lot in creating small tools for the command line.
It produces fast code, so for instance creating a program to navigate the 
entire file system can make it run significantly faster than in some alternative
programming languages.

But Rust can be used for all kinds of stuff, big and small. It has a growing
community and applicability. It's cross-platform, open source, and it's mostly
done as far as its own development goes. I hope that it will stabilize soon in
the next year after some major shoes drop in the form of the async support
and so on.

## The Name: Garantido

The name is inspired by a word in Portuguese that is symbolically associated
with a sort of carnival that takes place in the Brazilian Amazon, state of
Amazonas. Garantido is the name of one of the two main attractions
that take place there, with people associating themselves with either of them,
creating a rivalry that spices it up a bit. The 
["Boi Garantido"](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boi_Garantido) has for its
colors the red color, which I think has to do with the name of the Rust
programming language.
